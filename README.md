# üé¨ Flicker-Flix: Personalized Movie Recommendation System
> **üîó Live App:** (https://flickerflix.streamlit.app/)

---
## üìå Project Overview

This is a **content-based movie recommendation system** designed to assist users to watch similar movies based on their cinema taste. Unlike many similar projects that rely on static or limited datasets, this project uses **self-scraped 2 lakh+ movie metadata** to provide **highly adaptable and accurate recommendations**.

It features a clean and simple **Streamlit UI**, allowing users to search for any movie and receive personalized recommendations based on content similarity ‚Äî not ratings or user behavior.

## üß† Technical Details

This project uses a **Content-Based Filtering** technique. Here's how it works:

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**:  
   - 2lakh Movie metadata scraped from TMDB Api.
   - Includes genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overviews.

2. **Metadata Tag Creation**:  
   - Combined relevant features into a single `tag` column.
   - Cleaned and normalized text (e.g., lowercase, stemming, removing spaces).

3. **Vectorization & Similarity Calculation**:  
   - Used **CountVectorizer** to convert `tag` text into a numerical matrix.
   - Calculated **cosine similarity** between movies based on tag vectors.
   - Stored similarity scores and movie metadata into a serialized `.pkl` file for faster loading.

4. **Recommendation Logic**:  
   - User searches from a movie.
   - The app fetches the top N most similar movies from the precomputed similarity matrix.
   - Poster images are fetched dynamically using the TMDb API.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn** (TFIDF Vectorizer, Cosine Similarity)

## Future Improvements
1. Add user authentication on the site and save the user performance history.
2. Train a collaborative system using user-user or item-item data.
3. Build a hybrid system which recommends similar movies based on both **Content as well as collaborative filtering.**
